# Smart Medicine Reminder Kit

A comprehensive ESP32-based system for medication management and health monitoring, designed especially for senior citizens.

## Features

- **Medication Scheduling**: Set up medication schedules with specific times for each medicine chamber
- **Medicine Box Indicator**: LEDs indicate which medicine should be taken at the scheduled time
- **Missed Medication Alerts**: Automatic phone call reminders if medicine is not taken within 5 minutes
- **User Authentication**: Multi-user support with different roles (patient, caregiver, doctor)
- **Web Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for managing medication schedules and settings
- **Real-time Clock**: Accurate timekeeping even during power outages
- **Reed Switch Detection**: Monitors when medicine chambers are opened

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- DS3231 RTC Module
- GSM SIM900A Module
- 8x LEDs for medicine chambers
- Reed switch for medicine box detection
- Buzzer for local alerts
- 5V power supply

## Pin Configuration

- **LED Pins**: 13, 12, 14, 27, 26, 25, 33, 32
- **Reed Switch Pin**: 19
- **Buzzer Pin**: 5
- **GSM Module**: RX=3, TX=1

## Setup Instructions

1. Install PlatformIO IDE (VS Code extension)
2. Clone this repository
3. Open the project in PlatformIO
4. Install the required libraries through platformio.ini
5. Connect hardware components according to the pin configuration
6. Upload the code to your ESP32
7. Connect to the "Medicine Reminder Point" WiFi network (password: MedReminder123)
8. Access the web interface at 192.168.4.1
9. Create an account or use the default admin account (username: admin, password: admin123)
10. Configure medication schedules and patient phone number

## Usage

1. **Setting Up Medication Schedules**:
   - Log in to the web interface
   - Add medication schedules by selecting the chamber and time
   - Enter the patient's phone number for reminders

2. **Taking Medication**:
   - At the scheduled time, the corresponding LED will light up
   - A buzzer will sound for 30 seconds
   - If the medicine is not taken within 5 minutes, a call will be made to the registered phone number

3. **Managing Users**:
   - Create caregiver accounts for family members
   - Create doctor accounts for healthcare providers

## Development

This project is built with PlatformIO and uses the following libraries:

- ESPAsyncWebServer for the web interface
- RTClib for the real-time clock
- ArduinoJson for JSON parsing and generation
- LittleFS for file system operations
